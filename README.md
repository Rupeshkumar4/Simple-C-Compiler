# Simple-C-Compiler
<h2>The compiler is software that converts a program written in a high-level language (Source Language) to a low-level language (Object/Target/Machine Language/0, 1â€™s). 

A translator or language processor is a program that translates an input program written in a programming language into an equivalent program in another language. The compiler is a type of translator, which takes a program written in a high-level programming language as input and translates it into an equivalent program in low-level languages such as machine language or assembly language. 

The program written in a high-level language is known as a source program, and the program converted into a low-level language is known as an object (or target) program. Without compilation, no program written in a high-level language can be executed. For every programming language, we have a different compiler; however, the basic tasks performed by every compiler are the same. The process of translating the source code into machine code involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.</h2>
